# ChromeBoost — repo-developer guide

This file is for developers working ON chromeboost. The usage reference for
agents (Claude Code, Codex, etc.) lives in
`packages/plugin/skills/chromeboost/` (and `skills-codex/chromeboost/` for
the Codex variant). When in doubt, the canonical user-facing docs are in
the skill, not here.

## What chromeboost is

ChromeBoost is a Chrome extension + MCP server pair that lets coding
agents drive the user's real Chrome browser. The extension attaches via
CDP; the MCP server exposes 35 tools (`click_element`, `fill_input`,
`type_text`, `get_page_text`, `hover`, `drag`, `probe_point`, `hud`, etc.)
over the standard Model Context Protocol. Agents call those tools; the extension performs the operations
in the user's logged-in Chrome window.

The core differentiator is the click + keystroke pipeline: a humanlike
CDP bezier sequence with `pointerType: "mouse"` (firing PointerEvent
isPrimary=true alongside MouseEvent), settle-hover micro-tremor,
post-click jitter, and isTrusted=true keystrokes. This is what defeats
anti-bot checks on Reddit, X / Twitter, and similar isTrusted-strict
React UIs.

ChromeBoost adds two things on top of that inherited pipeline:

**Occlusion-aware cursor control.** Clicks hit-test before firing
(`content/hittest.ts`) instead of aiming at an element's geometric centre
and hoping nothing is on top. Covered targets are detected and reported;
covering layers are temporarily neutralised with `pointer-events: none`
so the same real CDP click reaches the target, then restored exactly.
`hover` and `drag` cover the UI that is not click-shaped at all.

**A HUD the user owns.** The on-page status panel (`content/hud.ts`) is
draggable, collapsible, dismissible, and persists its position — replacing
a fixed, `pointer-events: none` badge welded to the top-right corner.

## Development commands

**Build:**
```
cd packages/extension && node build.mjs    # extension → dist/
cd packages/extension && node pack.mjs     # dist/ → chromeboost-<version>.zip
bash packages/plugin/scripts/build-server.sh  # MCP server → packages/plugin/server/chromeboost.mjs
```

**Type-check:**
```
cd packages/extension && npx tsc --noEmit
cd packages/mcp-server && npx tsc --noEmit
```
Extension has some pre-existing TS errors in `stealth.ts` and
`content/find.ts` that are not load-bearing (the build uses esbuild,
not tsc). New errors should still be fixed.

**Test:**
```
# No unit tests today. Validation is manual + the anti-bot harness in
# tests/antibot/ (run locally; not in CI).
```

## Release process

1. Bump version in three files:
   - `packages/mcp-server/package.json`
   - `packages/plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
   - `packages/extension/manifest.json`
2. Rebuild extension and bundle: `node packages/extension/build.mjs &&
   bash packages/plugin/scripts/build-server.sh && node
   packages/extension/pack.mjs`.
3. Commit. Use the form `feat: X.Y.Z, <subject>`.
4. `git push`. GitLab CI publishes the npm package automatically when
   the version in `packages/mcp-server/package.json` differs from the
   one on the npm registry.
5. Manually upload the new `chromeboost-X.Y.Z.zip` to the Chrome Web
   Store dev console (the listing is not auto-published yet).

The GitLab CI pipeline definition is in `.gitlab-ci.yml`.

## Tool-surface philosophy

- **Prefer flags on existing primitives over new composite tools.** The
  user pruned the surface from 38 → 26 tools in 0.9.4 to fix bloat.
- **Boot-time warnings beat helper tools.** Where a diagnostic could
  be a `_doctor` or `_status` tool, prefer attaching the warning to
  the existing tool whose response would carry the diagnostic context.
- **Every response field should be structured.** Avoid free-text
  diagnostics that the agent has to parse; expose machine-readable
  fields like `silently_rejected`, `phase_timed_out`, `scope_missed`,
  `hidden_count`, `last_text`, `initial_match_warning`,
  `selector_in_shadow`, `shadow_hosts_seen`, etc.

## Code conventions

- TypeScript throughout. Strict mode in `tsconfig.json`. ES modules.
- The extension is MV3. Background is a service worker. Offscreen holds
  the WebSocket because service workers terminate on idle.
- Indentation: 2 spaces (extension), tabs (none — esbuild handles
  formatting). Run `prettier` if reformatting.
- Comments explain WHY, not WHAT. Code is the WHAT.
- No em-dashes / en-dashes / hyphens-as-dashes in commit messages or
  user-facing prose.
- ASCII math only in chat output and tool descriptions (no LaTeX).

## Where to look when a tool misbehaves

- **Click fired but page didn't react** → first check whether it was
  occluded: the response carries `occluded` / names what was pierced, and
  `probe_point(x, y)` prints the painted stack. Logic lives in
  `content/hittest.ts`; the pierce/restore orchestration is in
  `background.ts` `case "click_element"` (search `pierceToken`). If it
  wasn't occluded, the anti-bot path is in the same handler (search
  `silently_rejected`, `phase_timed_out`).
- **HUD misplaced, missing, or eating clicks** → `content/hud.ts`. State
  persists in `chrome.storage.local` under `cbHudState`; Alt+Shift+B
  toggles it. The host container is `pointer-events: none` — only the
  panel itself is interactive.
- **Fill landed in wrong field** → `content/fill.ts` (`findInput`
  match ranks, ambiguity refusal).
- **Shadow DOM not pierced** → grep for `queryAllDeep` in
  `content/shadow.ts` to confirm the call site is using it.
- **Screenshot hangs** → `background.ts` `case "screenshot"`
  (fullscreen fast-fail in 0.9.13+).
- **WS bridge timeouts** → `mcp-server/src/ws-bridge.ts`. Progress
  heartbeats from `type_text` route via `chromeboost-progress`
  runtime messages through offscreen.

## Validation harness

`tests/antibot/` contains the platform-validation scaffolding. Live
tests run locally with `tests/antibot/run-local.sh` (not in CI — real
target sites are flaky and have rate limits). The README in that
directory documents the validation approach and the platforms covered.

## Telemetry / data handling

- No outbound telemetry. The MCP server only talks to the local
  WebSocket bridge. The extension only talks to the active page and
  the offscreen-held WebSocket.
- `redact.ts` strips high-confidence secret patterns (API keys, JWTs)
  from `get_page_text` output so Claude doesn't accidentally read keys
  into context. Use `read_element` + `write_to_env` to capture
  specific values intentionally.

## The skill files

The user-facing reference. `packages/plugin/skills/chromeboost/SKILL.md`
is what plugin-installed agents read. The `references/` subdirectory
holds the deep-dive material (anti-bot, shadow-dom, forms, etc.). When
adding a new tool or changing a major behavior:

1. Update the relevant `references/<topic>.md`.
2. Mirror changes to `skills-codex/chromeboost/references/` (the Codex
   variant uses the same references; only the top-level SKILL.md
   differs).
3. If the new behavior is broadly relevant, add a one-line mention to
   the main SKILL.md routing table or the "Common quick recipes"
   section.
4. Run `packages/plugin/scripts/sync-skill.sh` to regenerate the Codex
   variant and copy the references across. `skills/chromeboost/SKILL.md`
   is the canonical source; never edit `skills-codex/` by hand.

Do NOT add new content to this file. Repo-developer concerns only.

## Things deliberately NOT in chromeboost

- No LLM-mediated extraction tool. Claude is the LLM; adding another
  model call would double the latency for no gain.
- No daemon / session-management layer. The extension is persistent;
  no daemon needed.
- No hosted / cloud variant. ChromeBoost's value prop is the user's
  real logged-in Chrome.
- No index-based element selection. textHint and selector resolve in
  one call; index-based would require a `get_state` round-trip.
- No `chromeboost_doctor` composite tool. Diagnostics attach to the
  tool whose response would already carry the relevant context.

## Distribution

ChromeBoost is distributed as a Claude Code plugin marketplace from
`github.com/lordamdal/chromeboost`. There is no npm package and no Chrome
Web Store listing.

The plugin carries **both halves**: the bundled MCP server at
`packages/plugin/server/chromeboost.mjs` and the built extension at
`packages/plugin/extension/`. Both are committed, so a fresh
`/plugin install chromeboost@chromeboost` works with no clone, no
`npm install`, and no build step. `packages/extension/build.mjs` syncs
`dist/` into the plugin on every build — if you change extension source,
run `npm run build` and commit the synced payload alongside it, or users
get a stale extension.

### The install path a user actually walks

`/chromeboost-setup` (`packages/plugin/commands/`) runs
`packages/plugin/scripts/install-extension.mjs`, which copies
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/extension` to `~/Downloads/ChromeBoost-Extension`
and prints `CHROMEBOOST_EXTENSION_PATH=<path>` as its last line.

The copy is deliberate, not incidental. Chrome loads unpacked extensions
*by path* and re-reads that path on every launch, so it has to live
somewhere stable and reachable — the plugin cache is neither: it's buried
several levels under `~/.claude/plugins/cache/`, hidden from the macOS file
picker by default, and its path changes on every plugin update. The script
writes a `DO-NOT-DELETE.txt` into the folder for the same reason.

Re-running overwrites in place, which makes it the upgrade path too: after
`/plugin update chromeboost`, re-run the command and hit reload on the
extension card — no re-picking the folder.

The command finishes by calling `list_tabs`. Do not remove that check; an
extension that loaded but never connected looks identical to a working one
from the Chrome side.
