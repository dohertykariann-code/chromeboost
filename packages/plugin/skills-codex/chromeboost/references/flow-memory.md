# Flow memory — learned site flows

chromeboost remembers the hard-won way to drive a site so you don't
rediscover it every session. It is **local, guidance-only, and explicit**:
nothing replays autonomously, nothing leaves the machine, and only steps
that *cost something to discover* are stored.

## Two signals you'll see in tool responses

**`known_flow`** — appears (once per origin per session) on `open_page`
and the first `click_element` against a site you've succeeded on before:

```
ℹ known_flow for https://www.reddit.com/submit — prefer these proven steps over rediscovery (verify each as usual):
  "submit text post" (3 steps, 4x ok):
   1. type_text textarea[name=title] (type_text)
   2. type_text div[name=body] (type_text)
   3. click_element #submit-post-button (until_url_change) [via dom-click]
```

**Follow it.** Prefer the recalled steps over rediscovering from scratch.
It's guidance, not autopilot — still pass your usual `until_*` so a stale
step fails loudly instead of acting on the wrong element. A step tagged
`⚠fragile-selector` (positional `nth-of-type`) is the one most likely to
have drifted; re-verify it first. A flow tagged `recorded on vX, re-verify`
came from older click logic.

**`flow_capturable`** — appears after chromeboost buffers a notable
resolution:

```
ℹ flow_capturable: 2 hard-won step(s) on https://www.reddit.com/submit not yet saved
  (click recovered via dom-click; field needs real keystrokes). Call save_flow("...") to persist them.
```

When you see this and the task succeeded, call `save_flow("<task label>")`.
You don't list the steps — chromeboost commits whatever it buffered for the
current origin. One call, done.

## What gets buffered (and what doesn't)

Captured (these cost retries to find):
- a click that succeeded only via a fallback (pointer-chain, DOM `.click()`,
  fiber, keyboard, React onChange sync) — surfaced as `recovered_via`
- a verified terminal action (`until_url_change` / navigating submit)
- `type_text` into an explicit selector ("this field needs real keystrokes",
  e.g. Reddit's Lexical title/body)

Skipped (rediscovery is free, persisting them is noise):
- first-try clicks on plainly-labelled buttons
- ordinary `fill_input` that landed first try
- plain text found in light DOM

## Storage

`~/.chromeboost/flows.json`, keyed by origin + path (query string stripped).
Selectors and success-signals only — **never** the typed text. Repeated
saves of the same flow bump its success count rather than duplicating.
