/**
 * Stop hook — occasionally asks for a GitHub star or a coffee.
 *
 * ChromeBoost is free and has no billing surface, so this prompt is the only
 * thing standing between "people find it useful" and "the author hears about
 * it". That earns it a place, but not much room. The rules it plays by:
 *
 *   1. Only after real use. It reads the tool-call counter the MCP server
 *      writes; a session where ChromeBoost sat idle never sees it. Asking for
 *      support from someone the tool hasn't helped is just spam.
 *   2. Rarely. First prompt at 20 tool calls, then at most once every 21 days.
 *   3. Alternating. Star, then coffee, then star — so it never reads as the
 *      same nag twice.
 *   4. Silenceable, and it says so. CHROMEBOOST_NO_NAG=1 turns it off for good.
 *
 * Emits {"systemMessage": ...}, which Claude Code shows to the user and does
 * NOT put in the model's context — the point is to reach the human without
 * spending the agent's tokens or derailing its next turn.
 *
 * Never throws and always exits 0: a support prompt must not be able to break
 * someone's session.
