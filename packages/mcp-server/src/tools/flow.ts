    `Click an interactive element by its visible text/aria-label (textHint) OR by direct CSS selector (selector). Pass exactly one.

\`textHint\` mode: fuzzy-rank against visible text, aria-label, button content. Ranks visible candidates ahead of hidden.

\`selector\` mode: pierces open AND closed shadow roots via queryAllDeep. Use when the target has no visible text (icon buttons, custom-element placeholders like Reddit's collapsed comment composer, drop-zone overlays). Skips the textHint matcher entirely. \`nth\` still picks the Nth match.

Optionally pass an until_* clause to verify the click took effect:
- until_selector — CSS selector that should appear after the click
- until_url_contains — substring that should appear in the URL (requires an actual URL change if the substring was already in the pre-click URL)
- until_text_contains — substring that should appear in page text
- until_url_changes — ANY URL change (use for submits where the destination URL is unknown ahead of time)
- expect_submit — broad anti-bot detector for form submissions (toast, alert, modal, URL change, form removal). See note below.

Returns {success, message, before_url, after_url, navigated}. \`navigated\` is true when the post-click URL differs from the pre-click URL — surfaces silent redirects without a second list_tabs call. Refuses to click 0×0 elements and now ranks visible candidates above hidden when text/aria match; when forced to refuse a hidden element it surfaces the next visible candidate in the error message.

Scope matching with \`within_selector\` or \`near_text\` restricts where matches are searched — useful for long forms with repeated labels per section (e.g. one "Approve" radio per row). \`within_selector\` is a CSS selector; \`near_text\` finds the nearest container whose heading starts with the given text.

Shadow DOM (open AND closed) is pierced by default via chrome.dom.openOrClosedShadowRoot — Reddit faceplate-* / r-post-form-submit-button / web-component-heavy SPAs no longer need manual deepFind recipes.

ANTI-BOT SUBMIT CEILING — synthetic clicks on social/auth platforms (Reddit, X / Twitter, mcp.so) are silently rejected by isTrusted-aware form validators and CSRF/reCAPTCHA gates. Pass \`expect_submit: true\` to detect this case (returns success=false with "submit silently rejected" when no signal fires within 4s). For confirmed anti-bot sites, do NOT retry — pre-fill the form, then highlight the submit button and call wait_for_click so a real human gesture fires the submission.`,

Coordinates are viewport CSS pixels, NOT screen coordinates. \`list_frames\` reports each iframe at \`(x, y, width, height)\` in this same space, so to click 50px in / 80px down inside an iframe: \`click_at_coordinates(frame.x + 50, frame.y + 80)\`.

Runs the same humanlike sequence as \`click_element\` (bezier approach path, settle-hover micro-tremor, press, release, post-click micro-move) so behavioural fingerprinters can't distinguish the call from any other chromeboost click. Skips the activity probe — cross-origin iframe activity isn't observable from the parent.

Refuses obviously-bad coordinates (negative, > 10000). Use this only when DOM matching has failed and you have a known target position from \`list_frames\` or a screenshot.

ChromeBoost: the response names the element that actually received the cursor (\`hit\`), so a click swallowed by a cookie banner is no longer indistinguishable from one that worked. When that element is visually transparent — the classic invisible click-catcher — the response says so and suggests \`pierce: true\`.

On a page whose main thread is saturated (heavy Angular/Ember dashboards — Google Analytics is the reference case), CDP input dispatch can stop acking in time. ChromeBoost shortens the gesture automatically when it detects high input latency, and if dispatch still can't finish it falls back to a synthetic click at the same point rather than failing. The response says which happened; a synthetic click is \`isTrusted=false\`, so an isTrusted-gated target will ignore it.`,

Pass \`shadow_root: true\` when waiting for the host's shadowRoot to attach (post-SPA-navigation hydration). \`scope_selector\` limits text-mode search; \`regex: true\` interprets text as a case-insensitive regex; \`frame: "iframe.selector"\` waits inside a same-origin iframe (text mode).

Text mode accepts an array — \`text: ["New session", "Error", "Stop"]\` resolves on the first match and the response carries \`matched_query\` so you know which entry fired. Useful for "wait for success OR failure" without a polling loop.

On timeout, the response carries \`last_text\` — the trailing 240 chars of the scope's content — so you can see the page state when the wait gave up. If the deploy panel shows "Starting up... 47%" and never reaches "Live", you'll see "Starting up... 47%" in last_text and know to extend the timeout instead of debugging a phantom failure.

Pass \`since: "now"\` in text mode to skip the initial check and only resolve on text appearing in a NEW DOM mutation — defeats the "stale instruction panels still in DOM" false-positive. When the wait DOES match on the initial check faster than 50ms, the response carries \`initial_match_warning\` suggesting since:"now" so you don't accidentally short-circuit on stale state.`,

Use this BEFORE calling find_text({frame: "..."}) or other frame-targeted tools — it shows you which frames exist and which are reachable. Knowing a frame is cross-origin up front means you can route to read_attachment (for the frame's src URL) or take_screenshot instead of getting a "frame not accessible" error from another tool.

Also use this as a quick diagnostic when execute_script returns an empty document on a page you can clearly see — non-zero \`shadow_hosts\` (especially closed roots) means switch to find_text / get_page_text / click_element / fill_input, which pierce shadow DOM via the extension's privileged API.

Per-frame fields:
- selector: CSS selector you can pass to other tools' \`frame\` parameter
- src: the iframe's src attribute (may be empty for about:blank frames)
- origin: parsed origin (e.g. "https://canvadoc.instructure.com") — empty when src is data:/javascript:/empty
- accessible: true if contentDocument is reachable (same-origin), false otherwise
- title: the iframe's title attribute, often the most human-readable identifier
- x, y, width, height: bounding-box position in viewport CSS pixels

Per-shadow-host fields:
- selector: short CSS hint for the host element (tag, id, or .class)
- open: true if the shadow root is exposed via \`el.shadowRoot\` (most web components), false if it is closed (Radix portals, Stencil/Lit defaults) — closed roots are invisible to execute_script but pierced by chromeboost's other tools.
